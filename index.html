        <p>The game was created by James Naismith, a physical education instructor, on December 21, 1891, at the International Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts.
        </p>
      <p>
        This game is played between two teams where each team has to score goal in the goalpost of other team and defend their own goalpost.
        In general there are 5 players in each team(including guards,forwards and center) but larger teams are preferred in professional teams and the number can go up to 12-15 members.
      </p>
      <p>
        To score a goal you need to dunk the ball in the opposing team's goalpost.
        The goal is a tower which is having a cylindrical hole with a net.
      </p>
      <p>
        The farther you score a goal from the tower the more points your team gets. 
      </p>
